# Movie Hub
As a frequent movie-goer, I need to quickly look up information on movies, especially critic reviews from [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com). I find it much more convenient to do it on the console rather than wasting time navigating through the browser just to find a few details about a movie.
