# Open Movie Database
As a frequent movie-goer, I need to quickly look up information on movies, especially critic reviews from [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com). I find it much more convenient to do it on the console rather than wasting time navigating through the browser just to find a few details of a movie.

## Powered by OMDb API
This console application is only made possible thanks to [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com). I recommend you check out Brian Fritz's website and consider supporting his work to ensure that the free web service remains sustainable.
